DataFrame students
+-------------+--------+
| Column Name | Type   |
+-------------+--------+
| student_id  | int    |
| name        | object |
| age         | int    |
+-------------+--------+

Write a solution to select the name and age of the student with student_id = 101.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
Input:
+------------+---------+-----+
| student_id | name    | age |
+------------+---------+-----+
| 101        | Ulysses | 13  |
| 53         | William | 10  |
| 128        | Henry   | 6   |
| 3          | Henry   | 11  |
+------------+---------+-----+

Overview
This problem provides us with a pandas DataFrame and requires us to return data about one of the records in the DataFrame.

Key Concepts:

DataFrame: a 2D table-like structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Each row represents an individual record and each column represents a different attribute. It is size-mutable designed to handle a mix of different types of data.
loc attribute: one of the primary ways to select data from a DataFrame. It is label-based, which means you have to specify the name of the rows or columns to select data. loc is label-based. If you are looking to use integer-based location, use iloc instead.
boolean mask: a series of True/False values used to filter or select elements from another data structure, such as a list, array, or DataFrame, based on a certain condition.
Intuition
The students DataFrame has three columns:

student_id (type: int) - a unique identifier for the student.
name (type: object, which is generally a string in pandas) - the student's name.
age (type: int) - the student's age.
In this problem, we must create a function that accepts a DataFrame as an argument and returns a DataFrame with the required information.

Inside our function, we will use the loc function to select the row where student_id is 101 and return the value from the name and age columns.

To do this, we must provide loc with two arguments.

students.loc[students['student_id'] == 101, ['name', 'age']]

When you pass this DataFrame to the function:

student_id	name	age
101	Ulysses	13
53	William	10
128	Henry	6
3	Henry	11

It will return:

name	age
Ulysses	13
